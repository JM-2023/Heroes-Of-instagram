## Art
The art assets used in this project are primarily free resources available online.

## Sound
Sound effects were sourced from YouTube by searching ["Super Mario Sound Effect"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_i1JO2EioY).

## Gameplay
The gameplay idea was inspired by an advertisement on Instagram. The advertised game turned out to be misleading, as it doesnâ€™t actually exist, so I decided to bring it to life, thinking it would be a fun project. The original concept was in 3D, but my version is designed in 2D. 

### Design Adjustments
During development, I encountered some challenges that required changes to the game design:
1. Initially, I intended to reward players by increasing the number of heroes with continuous shooting. However, this caused balance issues, as an excessive number of heroes became unmanageable. To address this, I modified the feature to add only one hero at a time and set a maximum limit on the number of heroes.

## Defect Fixes
- Fixed an issue where rewards would remain in the game, allowing them to trigger multiple times before being destroyed.
- Resolved a collision detection error.
- Corrected a bug where enemies with 0% health could still move on the map.
- Increased the hitbox size of rewards, making it appear larger than the actual visual representation.
